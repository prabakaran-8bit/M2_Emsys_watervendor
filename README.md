## Title : Water-Vendor system
Introduction In this project, we are going to make a Water vending system using ATMEGA328 microcontroller and coin validator .Coin validator we are using is GD100f.The GD100f is a three type coin accpetor.The coin validator  acts as a input it provides a pulse signal the to atmega 328.  The water pump is the output . Water pump will be mouted on top of water tank. The pump will dispense water from the tank once the pulse signal is given by the validator. For more accuracy water level sensor can be added to monitor the tank level.

## Research

__Objectives:__

•	This project aims to simplify the task of reducing the usage of plastic water bottles by implementing water-vending machines .
•	To develop an well-designed circut using coin validation sensensor and water pump . 
•	Provides full functional vendor to commericial areas. 
•	The objective of this project is to provide a comprehensive water management and reduce the usage of many bottles.

__Cost and Features__

•	Previously separate bottle were bought for each litre of bottles.
•	bottles can be reused.
•	cost of expenditure spend on water bottles can be reduced.
•	coin vending machine implemented on water.
•	Easily dispense water.
•	Various Essential needs regarding water can be reduced.

## 4W's and 1'H

__Who:__

•	All the organisation who wants to reduce the usage of use throw water bottles aswell as who dont wanna waste water.

__What:__

•	Earlier Many Companies and commercial places were inefficient due to the wastage of water and usage of too much water bottles.	

__When:__

•	As the wastage decreases the expenses also decreses .
•	With the decrease of expenses the cost spend on that expenses can be used on the development of the commercial.

__Where:__

•	This problem is surfaced in all the organisation in the world.

__How:__

•	This project takes in a coin and then dispense the water in the the bottle.
